The Estate App is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Users can seamlessly sign up, log in, and manage their real estate listings through secure and user-friendly interfaces. The application supports OAuth login with Gmail accounts for added convenience. User profiles can be updated with ease, and all React routes are protected to ensure a secure browsing experience. Leveraging Redux for state management enhances the efficiency of the application. Whether creating new listings, updating existing ones, or searching for properties, the Estate App provides a comprehensive platform for users to interact with real estate data.
